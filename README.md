Hi. I would like to use DeviceActivity framework for our app. (The app is an eye healthcare app)

The main function of our app is to check user screen time and give an alert to have a break time based on their screen time usage. 
It doesn`t restrict any app usage, but it only shows an alert to a user when the screen time reaches a threshold which is the setup time by the user. 

As far as I understood, I need to ask for user authorization for using Family Controls framework to monitor their screen. 

We expect to have your reply.
